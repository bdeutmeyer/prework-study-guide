# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage serves as a quick reference to the information I learned during Coding Boot Camp Prework. It covers the basics of four main topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It lists a few bits of information on the page itself, and it also provides links to PDFs of the notes I took as I was working through the modules. As a coding newbie, I will definitely need to refer back to these notes repeatedly, so having all of my notes into one place and making them accessible from anywhere will be very useful.
